## âœ¨ Key Insights & Actionable Recommendations  
Based on the sales data analysis, the following actionable insights and recommendations were identified:  
1. **Optimise Inventory for Peak Sales Periods**:  
   - Liberica coffee sees higher demand in winter months (Nov - Feb). Adjusting stock levels to cater to this trend will help ensure availability during peak periods.  
2. **Focus on High-Performing Regions and Products**:  
   - The **USA** has significantly higher sales compared to other regions. Allocate more stock to these regions to maximise returns.  
3. **Address Underperforming Areas**:  
   - The **UK and Ireland** regions show weaker performance. Target these markets with localised marketing campaigns or discount schemes to boost sales.  
4. **Enable Continuous Updates**:  
   - Regularly refresh the dashboard with new data to ensure insights remain up to date and relevant for decision-making.

**Subject**: Sales Insights and Recommendations for Maximising Revenue  

Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I hope this email finds you well.  

Following our recent discussions, Iâ€™ve analysed the sales data for your coffee products and have outlined some key insights and actionable recommendations to help maximise your revenue moving forward:  

- **Optimise Inventory for Peak Sales Periods**: Based on seasonal trends, different coffee beans show varying popularity throughout the year. Notably, **Liberica coffee** tends to see higher demand during the winter months (Nov - Feb), while other beans fluctuate throughout the year. Adjusting your inventory accordingly can help ensure product availability during peak times.  
- **Focus on High-Performing Regions and Products**: The **USA** has demonstrated significantly higher sales compared to other regions. Allocating additional resources and stock to these areas will likely help maximise returns. Prioritising high-demand products for these regions would also be beneficial.  
- **Monitor Underperforming Areas**: Certain regions, such as the **UK and Ireland**, show signs of underperformance. I recommend targeting these markets with locally tailored marketing campaigns or discount schemes to boost brand awareness and increase sales.  
- **Enable Continuous Updates**: To ensure the dashboard remains relevant and reflects the latest trends, itâ€™s important to regularly refresh the data. This will enable more up-to-date insights, allowing for quicker responses to market changes.

I believe these insights will help guide strategic decisions, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and opportunities are maximised.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of these points in further detail.  

Kind regards,  
Amy Pape (She/her)
